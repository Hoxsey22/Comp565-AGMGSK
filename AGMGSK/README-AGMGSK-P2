AGMGSK P2
----------
Author: Joseph Hoxsey & Simon Grigorian

Description
------------
- Main goal of this project is to modify how the NPAgent navigates and the pack behavior for the dogs using flocking. 

Specifications
---------------
1. Navigation for the NPAgent
2. Treasure-directed path following with Graph generation and navigation
3. Dog Pack Behavior

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes to the project
----------------------

Stage.cs
----------
-public void createGraph()
 -Creates nodes that are identified as walls, or objects, and used to later remove them from the graph 
 to avoid collision and have the a star navigate with only the available nodes.
 
 ***This is where we had trouble in the AStar navigation part of the project. We kept getting a null pointer
 reference for some reason for the treasure node. Please note it is commented out so avoid the game from 
 crashing.

NavNode.cs
----------
-Added information that contians about the navigation nodes and path to the treasures such as:
cost, predecessornodes, adjacent, offset, z, x... etc.

NPAgent.cs
----------
-NP agent override void update contains information of our treasureDetection() method which allows us to detect when we are
near the treasure nav to use our AStar path. 


Create new classes:
NavGraph.cs
 ------------
 -This class was created to hold all the Dictionary (like HashMap) navigation nodes. It holds open,
 closed, and path sets for the A star Algorithm.
 
 Pack.cs
 -------
Class used to create packing, and flocking behavior. Pressing p increases the probability.
